Twilight 2 color scheme
=======================

This is based off the Twilight Theme from TextMate 2, with a few Tweaks for OS.

I'm not the original author, I just need a repo to exist for
[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle).

Theme was converted using [coloration](http://github.com/sickill/coloration) and
tweaked by me.

Enjoy!
